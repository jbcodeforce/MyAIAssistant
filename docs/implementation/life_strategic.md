# Life Strategy
["Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk) is a feature from Harvard Business Review (HBR) based on the work of Rainer Strack, Susanne Dyrchs, and Allison Bailey. It explores how corporate strategy principles can be applied to personal life to ensure you are living with purpose rather than just reacting to day-to-day demands.

## Core Framework: The Life Strategy Process

* Define a "Great Life": Success isn't one-size-fits-all. You must identify what truly matters to you across different dimensions, such as health, relationships, career, and personal growth.
* Assess Your "Portfolio": Just as a company reviews its products, you should review your current life activities. Are you spending time on things that align with your definition of a "great life"?
* Identify Your Purpose and Vision: * Purpose: Your fundamental reason for being.
* Vision: A clear picture of what you want your life to look like in the future (e.g., 5–10 years from now).
* Make Strategic Choices: Strategy is about trade-offs. You must decide what to say "no" to so you can focus your limited resources (time, energy, and money) on your highest priorities.

## PERMA-V

* P: Positive Emotion: Do I have a lot of contentment in my life?
* E: Engagement: feeling the flow when doing thing 
* R: Relationship: Family, friends, colleagues, others
* M: Meaning: classical one is making the world a better place
* A: Achievements: number of goals achieved
* V: Vitality: heath

## Defining Portfolio

* A Strategic Life Portfolio
* **Strategic Life Units**: what are the things to invest time, money and energy

| Strategic Life Area	| Strategic Life Units (SLUs) |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1. Relationships	    | 1. Partner/Spouse           |
| | 2. Children/ Family |
| | 3. Friends |
| 2. Body & Mind | 4. Physical Health/Sports |
| | 5. Mental Health/Mindfulness |
| | 6. Spirituality |
| 3. Community - society | 7. Community/citizenship |
| | 8. Societal engagement |
| 4. Job, learning, finances	| 9. Core Work/Job Tasks |
| | 10. Learning/ Education |
| | 11. Finances |
| 5. Leisure | 12. Hobbies/Passions |
| | 13. Online entertainment (TV, Social Media) |
| | 14. Offline entertainment- book-blogs |
| 6. Personal care	| 15. Physiological needs |
| | 16. Daily life activities | 

The goal of listing these 16 units is to help you conduct a "Portfolio Analysis":
* Assess where you are investing your 168 hours each week in each SLUs
* Rate the important of each SLU from 0 to 10
* Rate the level of satisfaction with each SLUs from 0 to 10

Organize a 2x2 Matrix based on two metrics:

1. **Importance:** How much does this unit contribute to your "Great Life"?
2. **Satisfaction:** How happy are you with this area right now?

The "bubble size" for each unit on the matrix represents the Time you actually spend on it. This visual helps you identify "Strategic Gaps"—areas that are high in importance but low in satisfaction and time investment.

## Key Takeaways

* "if you do not know which port you sailing to, no wind is favorable" and "Luck is when preparation meets opportunity." quotes from the philosopher: Seneca
* Proactive vs. Reactive: Most people live "reactively," responding to emails, chores, and immediate requests. Strategic thinking shifts you to "proactive" mode, where your actions are driven by long-term goals.
* The Power of Trade-offs: You cannot have everything at once. Strategic thinking helps you accept these trade-offs consciously rather than letting them happen by accident.
* Iterative Process: Life strategy isn't a one-time event; it requires regular check-ins to adjust as your circumstances and values evolve.

## Matching implementation

The view helps to define new assessment, manage existing ones, and view the 2x2 matrix.
